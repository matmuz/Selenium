# Selenium

Project based on Sii's example app (PrestaShop). The purpose of this project is to show a sample of Java and Selenium - a testing framework in this case. My focus is the English version of the App (you can switch between Polish and English).

To run tests (Java and Maven required!):

 From an IDE:

    1. Download the project
    2. Open the project
    3. Right click on testng.xml file and run
    4. Done!

 From CMD:

    1. Download the project
    2. Use CMD to navigate to project
    3. Run mvn clean test command
    4. Done!

Finally, to run test reports (Allure required!) use command allure serve <path_to_allure-reports_in_project>.

You can also use provided scripts to run tests, run reports and clean reports.
